5: (picture) potter.jpg -> 10
10: (NARRATOR) You are in a busy and crowded train station. It is full of people trying to go somewhere. Amongst the busyness, there is a family dressed in slightly peculiar robes. There are two sons, JAMES POTTER and ALBUS POTTER, who are pushing two overflowing carts. Their mother, GINNY, follows after. A thirty-seven-year-old man, HARRY, has his daughter, LILY, on his shoulders. -> 12
12: (Ginny) We'll write to you every day ALBUS! [13,14,15]
13: (ALBUS) No. Not every day. James says most people only get letters from home about once a month. -> 17
14: (ALBUS) You better! -> 17
15: (ALBUS) Mom, I'm 12 years old now. I'm no longer a little kid. -> 17
16: (HARRY) We wrote to your brother three times a week last year. Don't believe everything your brother says about Hogwarts, Albus. -> 17
17: (JAMES) Can we go now please? [18, 19, 20]
18: (ALBUS) Yes, I can't wait to get on that train! -> 22
19: (ALBUS) I can't believe I actually get to go to Hogwarts. -> 22
20: (ALBUS) I don't know...maybe I should just wait until next year. -> 21
21: (NARRATOR) HARRY pretends he didn't hear you... -> 22
22: (HARRY) Ok, let's do this! Remember don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a run if you're nervous. -> 23
23: (ALBUS) I'm ready. -> 24

24: (music) scene_2_music.mp3 -> 25

26: (NARRATOR) The family interlocks their hands and runs hard into the barrier together. -> 27

30: (startmusicloop) scene_2_background.mp3 -> 31


31: (picture) express.jpg -> 32
32: (NARRATOR) Instead of people in sharp suits going about their day, the platform is now full of wizards and witches in robes mostly trying to work out how to say good-bye to their beloved children. [34,35,36]
34: (ALBUS) Wow, this is it. Platform 9 3/4. -> 37
35: (ALBUS) Mom, I am really thinking we might want to wait a year... -> 37
36: (ALBUS) I see Uncle Ron! -> 37
37: (LILY) Where are they? Are they here? Maybe they didn't come? -> 39
39: (NARRATOR) HARRY points out RON, HERMIONE, and their daughter, ROSE. LILY runs hard up to them. -> 41
41: (LILY) Uncle Ron. Uncle Ron!!! -> 62
62: (picture) reunion.jpg -> 42

42: (NARRATOR) RON turns towards them as LILY goes barreling up to him. He picks her up into his arms. -> 43
43: (RON) If it isn't my favorite Potter. -> 45
45: (NARRATOR) You start to get anxious when you think about the sorting hat's decision tonight. You pull on HARRY's robes. HARRY looks down. -> 47
47: (ALBUS) Do you think I...What if I am put in Slytherin? -> 48
48: (HARRY) And what would be wrong with that? [49, 50, 51]
49: (ALBUS) Slytherin is the House of the snake, of Dark Magic . . . It's not a House of brave wizards. -> 52
50: (ALBUS) But Potters are supposed to be in Gryffindor. -> 52
51: (ALBUS) Everyone knows that Slytherins are evil!-> 52
52: (HARRY) Albus Severus, you were named after two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew. [53,54,55]
53: (ALBUS) I know the sorting hat will take into account how I feel. -> 56
54: (ALBUS) I guess you're right Dad. -> 56
55: (ALBUS) I don't care about Snape! I just want to be a Gryffindor. -> 56
56: (HARRY) Remember, the sorting hat is there for a reason. You are going to love Hogwarts so much. -> 57
57: (HARRY) Albus, if you don't want this train to leave without you, you should probably leap on! -> 58
58: (HERMIONE) Rose. Remember to send Neville our love. -> 59
59: (ROSE) Mom, I can't give a professor love! -> 60

60: (music) scene_3_music.mp3 -> 61

61: (NARRATOR) Rose exits for the train. Your hug your family one last time before following after her. -> 65

63: (H1) ACT ONE, SCENE THREE -> 64
64: (H2) THE HOGWARTS EXPRESS -> 67

67: (NARRATOR) You walk along the carriage of the train with Rose. The TROLLEY WITCH approaches, pushing her trolley. -> 71
71: (TROLLEY WITCH) Anything from the trolley, dears? Pumpkin Pasty? Chocolate Frog? Cauldron Cake? -> 72
72: (ROSE) {spotting ALBUS's loving look at the Chocolate Frogs} Albus. We need to concentrate. [73, 75, 77]
73: (ALBUS) Concentrate on what? -> 74
74: (ROSE) On who we choose to be friends with.  -> 75
75: (ALBUS) Agreed! What candy should we eat first? -> 76
76: (ROSE) Not that! We need to choose who to be friends with.  -> 79
77: (ALBUS) Yeah, I'm not exactly feeling sweets right now either. -> 78
78: (ROSE) Who do you want to be friends with? -> 79
79: (ROSE) My mum and dad met your dad on their first Hogwarts Express, you know . . . [80,81,82]
80: (ALBUS) So we need to choose now who to be friends with for life? That's quite scary. -> 83
81: (ALBUS) Yeah but they also met a bunch of other people I'm sure. -> 83
82: (ALBUS) One step at a time Rose. Let's just focus on getting to Hogwarts and then we can talk to people. -> 83
83: (ROSE) Come on. I'm a Granger-Weasley, you're a Potter — everyone will want to be friends with us, we've got the pick of anyone we want. [84,85,87]
84: (ALBUS) So how do we decide which compartment to go in . . . -> 86
85: (ALBUS) How do you suggest we decide who to be friends with then. -> 86
86: (ROSE) We rate them all and then we make a decision. -> 89
87: (ALBUS) Let's just find a compartment and sit in it like everyone else. -> 89

89: (picture) scorpius.jpg -> 91

91: (NARRATOR) The cabin opens with a soft sound, revealing a single blonde headed boy sitting alone. [93,94,95]
93: (ALBUS) Hi. Is this compartment open? -> 96
94: (ALBUS) Hey - what's your name? -> 97
95: (ALBUS) Hi, I'm the son of Harry Potter. -> 98
96: (SCORPIUS) Hi! Yeah it's just me in here. My name's Scorpius! Who are you? [100,101,102]
97: (SCORPIUS) My name is Scorpius. What about you? [100,101,102]
98: (SCORPIUS) Oh...um. Hi Scorpius. I mean, I'm Scorpius. You're Albus. I'm Scorpius. And you must be... -> 99
99: (ROSE) Rose. -> 106
100: (ALBUS) You can call me Albus. -> 104
101: (ALBUS) Oh, don't worry about my name. -> 103
102: (ALBUS) It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Albus. -> 104
103: (ROSE) Don't listen to him. His name is Albus and I'm Rose. -> 106
104: (SCORPIUS) And who is your friend? -> 105
105: (ROSE) My name's Rose. -> 106
106: (ROSE) Albus, actually we should get going pretty soon to the next cabin. -> 107
107: (SCORPIUS) But wait - I haven't even offered you some of my Fizzing Whizbees yet. Would you like one? -> 108
108: (ROSE) I've just had breakfast, thanks. -> 109
109: (SCORPIUS) I've also got some Shock-o-Choc, Pepper Imps, and some Jelly Slugs. Mum's idea — she says, "Sweets, they always help you make friends." {He realizes that singing was a mistake.} Stupid idea, probably. [110, 111, 112]
110: (ALBUS) That honestly all sounds really terrible. Have any banana bread? -> 116
111: (ALBUS) I'll have some...Mum doesn't let me have sweets. Which one would you start with? -> 117
112: (ALBUS) Oh wow. Definitely want to try the Pepper Imps! -> 114
114: (NARRATOR) Rose hits you out of sight of SCORPIUS -> 118
116: (SCORPIUS) Um...nope just have the sweets. I thought all kids like Sweets. [120,121,122]
117: (SCORPIUS) Easy. -> 118
118: (SCORPIUS) I've always regarded the Pepper Imp as the king of all candy. They're peppermint sweets that make you smoke at the ears. [121, 122, 123]
120: (ALBUS) I'm just kidding. I will take a Pepper Imp! -> 125
121: (ALBUS) Actually, come to think of it, we really should be headed to the next train car. -> 168
122: (ALBUS) Awesome. Rose you should really try one. -> 125
123: (ALBUS) Brilliant. Could I have a Pepper Imp please? -> 125
125: (ROSE) {Rose hits you out of sight of SCORPIUS} We really must be going. [126,127,128]
126: (ALBUS) Rose, will you please stop hitting me? -> 129
127: (ALBUS) Oh...yeah I guess you are right Rose. Thanks anyway Scorpius. We must be off. -> 168
128: (ALBUS) Rose, I'm serious. You've probably never had a sweet in your life but they are really delicious. -> 182
129: (ROSE) I'm not hitting you. [130,131,132]
130: (ALBUS) What? Oh I must have imagined it then. Hey Scorpius, Rose and I actually have to leave. -> 168
131: (ALBUS) You *are* hitting me. And it hurts. -> 133
132: (ALBUS) Look, Rose, you can say anything you want in front of Scorpius. -> 133
133: (SCORPIUS) She's hitting you because of me. [134,135,136]
134: (ALBUS) What do you mean? -> 137
135: (ALBUS) Just because of who your parents are? -> 141
136: (ALBUS) Wait you guys know each other already? -> 137
137: (SCORPIUS) Listen, I know who you are, so it's probably only fair you know who I am. [138,139,140]
138: (ALBUS) What do you mean you know who I am? -> 141
139: (ALBUS) I hate being the son of the most famous Wizard in the world. -> 141
140: (ALBUS) How could it possibly matter who you are? It's the first day of school! -> 141
141: (SCORPIUS) You're Albus Potter. She's Rose Granger-Weasley. And I am Scorpius Malfoy. My parents are Astoria and Draco Malfor. Our parents - they didn't like each other. -> 142
142: (ROSE) That's putting it mildly. Your mum and dad are Death Eaters! -> 143
143: (Scorpius) {affronted} Dad was but Mum wasn't! -> 144
144: (ROSE) Your father and his goons were responsible for many of our parents closest friend's deaths! That's not something to just forgive so easily. -> 145
145: (ROSE) Come on Albus, we should probably sit somewhere else. [146,147,148]
146: (ALBUS) No, Rose. I think I'll stay here actually. You go if you want. -> 149
147: (ALBUS) Rose, come on. We're not our parents and neither is Scorpius. You have to give everyone a chance. -> 182
148: (ALBUS) Yeah let's go. Sorry Scorpius, nothing personal but we have to keep moving. -> 168
149: (ROSE) Albus, I won't wait. [150, 151, 152]
150: (ALBUS) And I wouldn't expect you to. I'm staying here though. -> 153
151: (ALBUS) Ugh, you're right. Ok, let's move on. -> 168
152: (ALBUS) Go ahead but I really think you shouldn't write someone off before you even know them. -> 182
153: (ROSE) Fine! -> 154
154: (NARRATOR) Rose looks at you for a second and then leaves the compartment. -> 155
155: (NARRATOR) You are left alone in the cabin with Scorpius alone. You both look at each other unsure of what to do next. ->156
156: (SCORPIUS) Thank you. [157, 158, 159]
157: (ALBUS) Oh, I didn't stay for you. I stayed for your sweets! -> 160
158: (ALBUS) Don't mention it. Neither of us should be defined by what our parents did here 20 years ago. -> 160
159: (ALBUS) Now what? -> 160
160: (SCORPIUS) Rose is quite fierce. [161, 162, 163]
161: (ALBUS) Yeah sorry about that. -> 164
162: (ALBUS) Yeah but she is a good person. -> 164
163: (ALBUS) I know. She cares about all the wrong things though. -> 164
164: (SCORPIUS) Here, try a Pepper Imp. But be warned! Smoke will *literally* come out of your ears. -> 165
165: (NARRATOR) You end up chatting with Scorpius for the rest of the train ride and time flies by. You soon find yourself in the Great Hall of Hogwarts...ready to be sorted into a house. -> 195
168: (SCORPIUS) {sounding dejected} Oh yeah, I guess you guys probably have other people you need to talk to. -> 169
169: (ROSE) I'm sure you understand. We really shouldn't be seen with the son of a Death Eater. -> 170
170: (SCORPIUS) Yeah I understand... [171, 172,173]
171: (ALBUS) Wait I don't want anyone judging me based on my Dad. Let's stay. -> 149
172: (ALBUS) Yeah let's get out of here Rose. -> 175
173: (ALBUS) Hey nice to meet you Scorpius. -> 175
175: (NARRATOR) You leave the cabin with Rose - the door shuts behind you. [176,177,178]
176: (ALBUS) Maybe we shouldn't have been so harsh. Poor guy.  -> 179
177: (ALBUS) Well that was awkward. Hopefully he can find some friends.  -> 179
178: (ALBUS) That guy gave me the creeps! -> 179
179: (ROSE) Yeah let's just forget about it. I hope the next cabin has some Gryffindors in it.  -> 195
182: (ROSE) Albus, I honestly wonder what goes on inside your head sometimes. Come on, let's go. [183,184,185]
183: (ALBUS) Rose, you're better than this.  -> 186
184: (ALBUS) I guess we should move on but I still don't think you're right. -> 168
185: (ALBUS) I think you should really reconsider. -> 186
186: (ROSE) Hmm...ok fine. Let's stay for a bit but we really do need to move along eventually. -> 187
187: (SCORPIUS) You guys are gonna stay?? Awesome! -> 188
188: (SCORPIUS) So do you guys want some sweets? I've really got way too much. [189,190,191]
189: (ALBUS) I would love a Pepper Imp  -> 193
190: (ALBUS) Rose do you want anything? -> 193
191: (ALBUS) Yeah one of everything please! -> 193
193: (NARRATOR) You start talking with Scorpius and realize he is actually a really nice kid. In fact, he is a bit of a geek. Rose stays for most of the trip but eventually moves on. -> 195
195: (TITLE) ACT ONE SCENE FOUR -- Hogwarts Great Hall -> 197
197: (NARRATOR) You are now in the Great Hall of Hogwarts for the first time in your life. You've heard many stories of its grandness but are blown away by wonder all the same. -> 199
199: (NARRATOR) It is time for you to be sorted into one of the four Houses of Hogwarts. You are filled with a mix of dread and excitement. -> 201
201: (HEADMASTER) Will the next student, Albus Potter, please come to the front of the stage to be sorted. -> 203
203: (NARRATOR) There is a not so hushed murmur as the famous last name is recognized universally throughout the hall as you walk up to the sorting hat. -> 205
205: (SORTING HAT) Ahh, another Potter. Always an...interesting challenge. [207,208,209]
207: (ALBUS) Please just put me in Griffindor. -> 210
208: (ALBUS) Make it quick please. -> 211
209: (ALBUS) What is challenging about my family? We've always gone to Griffindor. -> 212
210: (SORTING HAT) Are you really that nervous I might put you in Slytherin? [213,214,215]
211: (SORTING HAT) Ah what's the rush? Are you nervous I might put you in Slytherin? [213,214,215]
212: (SORTING HAT) That's true, but I don't think you appreciate how close some of those calls have been. [213,214,215]
213: (ALBUS) I'm the farthest thing from a Slytherin! -> 216
214: (ALBUS) I have nothing against any of the houses. -> 217
215: (ALBUS) Sort me where you will. You know best. -> 218
216: (SORTING HAT) That is for me to determine, not you young one. -> 219
217: (SORTING HAT) Don't lie to me when I am inside of your head like this! I can see everything. -> 219
218: (SORTING HAT) Ahh, a suck up. That's very Ravenclaw of you. -> 219
219: (SORTING HAT) But tell me, why do you really want to be in Griffindor in the first place? [220,221,222]
220: (ALBUS) I'm a Potter. It's where I belong. -> 223
221: (ALBUS) Because I want to be brave and always do the right thing! -> 224
222: (ALBUS) It's the only house I have ever known. -> 225
223: (SORTING HAT) Your last name has nothing to do with this. [226, 227, 228]
224: (SORTING HAT) Being sorted into a house won't make you into anything. That is up to you regardless of my decision tonight. [226, 227, 228]
225: (SORTING HAT) Ahhh, would you like to know another one? [231,232,233]
226: (ALBUS) Yeah I guess you're right. Sort me as you please. -> 229
227: (ALBUS) If I am in Griffindor, I will always remember you favorably. -> 229
228: (ALBUS) I give up in trying to convince you of anything. -> 230
229: (SORTING HAT) No one commands me but only one house thinks they can. SLYTHERIN IT IS. -> 238
230: (SORTING HAT) Now you finally get it. Ok, let's see. I will admit this is a confusing one. Ahh, yes. SLYTHERIN!! -> 238
231: (ALBUS) Honestly not really. -> 234
232: (ALBUS) I have always been curious about Slytherin. -> 235
233: (ALBUS) Sure, but obviously I am not curious about Hufflepuff. -> 236
234: (SORTING HAT) Ok...I have come to my decision. I think you will come to appreciate it in time-- SLYTHERIN! -> 238
235: (SORTING HAT) Veeeery Interesting. As you wish, SLYTHERIN it is! -> 238
236: (SORTING HAT) Haha! I see you have a sense of humor that was never present in your father. And for that, I decide SLYTHERIN!  -> 238
238: (NARRATOR) A deafening silence immediately sweeps across the Hall instead of the usual applause. Slowly, some of the Slytherins process the news and slowly start to clap and gesture for you to come join them.
